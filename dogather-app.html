			<h3>DoGather App</h3>
			<h6>YEAR – 2019<br>
				ROLE – Solo student project</h6>
		</div>

		<div class="projdescription">
			<p>Towards the end of a school term or semester, you‘ll see students churning out last minute work to meet assignment deadlines or cramming information the night before an exam. The objective of this project is to understand students' study
				behaviour and design a tool that can help students avoid last minute work.
				The process follows a double diamond approach, incorporating the stages of Discover, Define, Design, and Deliver.</p>

			<h3>Discovery</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="projdescription">
			<p>I interviewed 10 university students to understand their study habits, challenges, and motivations. </p>
			<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li><b>We're-all-in-this-together mindset</b></li>All students mentioned that they benefit from studying in a group as it motivates them/allows them to exchange knowledge. School and public library are the most popular study spots although
				some
				students commented that it is always packed during exam season.<br> <br>
				<li><b>Mobile phones as the biggest distraction</b></li>Most students mentioned that their phone (social media) distracts them most. One mentioned they delete social media apps from their phone nearing assignment deadline.<br> <br>
				<li><b>All students already use some form of tool (digital or analog) to aid productivity</b></li>To-do lists are the most popular tool, followed by calendar time-blocking, and mobile phone settings for screen downtime.<br> <br>
			</ol>
			<h4>A deeper dive into productivity...</h4>
			<p><b>“If you’re about to dive into a piece of work that requires intense mental focus, you might find it helps to sit next to someone else who is concentrating hard.” – The British Psychological Society</b></p>
			<p>While doing secondary research, I learnt about a community of students who own/follow social media accounts posting content about studying – from productivity tips to stationery recommendations.</p>
			<p>There is a part of the online study community that I was particularly intrigued by; some of the accounts host virtual “study sessions” where they either live stream or film themselves studying in real time while an online audience watch and
				study together with them. After watching a couple videos, I decided to reach out to some of these content creators on Instagram, to ask why they do it.</p>

			<h3>Ideation & Design</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="projdescription">
			<p>With the results and insights of the initial research in mind, I began brainstorming for app feature ideas and placed them in a MoSCoW matrix. I sketched rough wireframes to get a sense of how it could work, then validated the flow with some
				of students.</p>

			<p>The solution is a task management app that allows university students to host virtual group study sessions and become more productive, together. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/14144464-acf3-400d-b9f3-a5bbde676499-4147/" target="_blank"

			<h3>Reflections</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="projdescription">
			<p>This was my ✨first ever✨ UI/UX project that I did and I'm really proud of the concept of this app. I also did a lot of self-learning through the internet, where I got introduced to various UX methodologies and processes.
				In retrospect, here are some things I would've done differently:<br></p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Learn to be more iterative in my design process. Instead of wasting time deciding which is the better option, test with the users and learn – research is on-going!</li>
				<li>More usability testings with strangers (instead of classmates & friends) to avoid biased feedback. I think my friends were too kind to tell me to change my design. I definitely could've made better use of the space in the homepage.</li>
				<li>This can be a good feature to integrate into existing school LMS platforms. I would love to hear some feedback on this idea from university/teaching staffs.</li>
