                    The goal of DePuy Synthes China is to increase the TomoFix
                    patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) market. TomoFix is a
                    3D printed cutting guide used in high tibial osteotomy (HTO)
                    that reduces surgery time and improves patient outcome. One
                    of their strategies is to digitalize the end-to-end service
                    of PSI products to better serve Chinese surgeons and
                    targeted patients. The business team reached out to J&J
                    Design to answer this question:

                        How might we design an effective digital platform for
                        orthopaedic surgeons to order and manage their TomoFix
                        cases so that surgeons have more time in caring for
                        their patients?

                    Working in a cross-functional team, I was responsible for
                    creating user flows, UI style guide*, and wireframes for key
                    features of the surgeon platform, as well as collecting
                    feedback and iterating. The result is a shortened lead time
                    from 10 days to 5 days, and the product is projected to
                    twice the market size from 2022 to 2023 (data provided by
                    business team).

                    A 2-month contextual research had been conducted by an
                    external service design agency; gaining first-hand
                    perspectives of surgeons, CT physicians, local distributors,
                    and internal J&J sales and design engineers. The report
                    helped to define the problem and provided actionable
                    insights for us to kick-start designing the platform.

                    The surgeons' mindset when they enter the platform is rarely
                    to browse or explore but to get things done efficiently. To
                    facilitate their workflow, the primary components of the

                    Working on TRUMATCH™ has been really gratifying, the
                    platform serves thousands of healthcare providers. It was my
                    first time working on a project with the China team, it was
                    challenging and fast-paced, but I learned that the key was
                    having clear communication channels to align with
                    stakeholders efficiently. Overall, it was a really
                    successful MVP launch and I'm excited to see the next
                    version of the platform and its feature improvements.
